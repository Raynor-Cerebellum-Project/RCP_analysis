# Analysis Codes: Behavioral and Neural pipline for the Raynor Project

## Overview
This repository contains the analysis pipeline for processing, quantifying, and comparing stimulation trials from the Raynor experiments. The workflow is designed to handle segmented movement trials with and without stimulation, calculate behavioral metrics, and visualize condition-specific effects. Neural data analysis will be added, currently artifact correction is already added.
